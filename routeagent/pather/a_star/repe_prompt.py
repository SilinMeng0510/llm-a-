Identify a path between the start and goal points to navigate around obstacles and find the shortest path to the goal. 
Horizontal barriers are represented as [y, x_start, x_end], and vertical barriers are represented as [x, y_start, y_end].
Conclude your response with the generated path in the format "Generated Path: [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...]".

Start Point: [5, 5]
Goal Point: [20, 20]
Horizontal Barriers: [[10, 0, 25], [15, 30, 50]]
Vertical Barriers: [[25, 10, 22]]
- First Iteration on [5, 5]
Thought: The horizontal barrier at y=10 spanning x=0 to x=25 blocks the direct path to the goal. To navigate around it, we should move to the upper-right corner of the barrier.
Selected Point: [26, 9]
Evaluation: The selected point [26, 9] effectively bypasses the horizontal barrier, positioning us at its corner and maintaining progress toward the goal without encountering additional obstacles.
- Second Iteration on [26, 9]
Thought: Now that we have bypassed the horizontal barrier, the path to the goal seems clear.
Selected Point: [20, 20]
Evaluation: The path is obstructed by the vertical barrier, leading to a collision. A more effective route involves moving around this vertical barrier.
Thought: To bypass the vertical barrier at x=25, we should move along its length and then turn around it to continue toward the goal.
Selected Point: [25, 23]
Evaluation: The selected point [25, 23] successfully avoids the vertical barrier and brings us closer to the goal without encountering further obstacles.
- Third Iteration on [25, 23]
Thought: From this position, there are no barriers directly obstructing the path to the goal.
Selected Point: [20, 20]
Evaluation: The path to the goal is clear from here, allowing a direct move to the goal.
Generated Path: [[5, 5], [26, 9], [25, 23], [20, 20]]

Start Point: [2, 3]
Goal Point: [18, 8]
Horizontal Barriers: [[7, 0, 10], [5, 30, 40]]
Vertical Barriers: [[14, 12, 30], [40, 0, 11]]
- First Iteration on [2, 3]
Thought: The horizontal barrier at y=7 spanning x=0 to x=10 obstructs the direct path. To bypass it, move to the end of the barrier.
Selected Point: [11, 6]
Evaluation: The point [11, 6] navigates around the horizontal barrier, positioning us at its edge and closer to the goal.
- Second Iteration on [11, 6]
Thought: With the barrier behind us, the path to the goal is clear, allowing us to proceed directly to the goal.
Selected Point: [18, 8]
Evaluation: The path is unobstructed from here to the goal, enabling a straightforward move to [18, 8].
Generated Path: [[2, 3], [11, 6], [18, 8]]

Start Point: [25, 25]
Goal Point: [4, 4]
Horizontal Barriers: [[7, 0, 20], [15, 10, 15]]
Vertical Barriers: [[10, 15, 30], [30, 0, 18], [10, 0, 5]]
- First Iteration on [25, 25]
Thought: The horizontal barrier at y=15 spanning x=10 to x=15 blocks the direct path. To avoid it, we should move downward and then navigate around it.
Selected Point: [10, 10]
Evaluation: Moving to [10, 10] positions us midway toward a different horizontal barrier at y=7 spanning x=0 to x=20, which may unnecessarily increase path length.
Thought: To bypass the horizontal barrier at y=7, we need to move downward until we clear its end.
Selected Point: [21, 7]
Evaluation: The selected point [21, 7] successfully clears the horizontal barrier at y=7, setting us up for a more direct path to the goal.
- Second Iteration on [21, 7]
Thought: The vertical barrier at x=10 spanning y=0 to y=5 obstructs the direct path. We should navigate around it.
Selected Point: [10, 6]
Evaluation: The point [10, 6] effectively bypasses the vertical barrier, bringing us closer to the goal.
- Third Iteration on [10, 6]
Thought: There are no obstacles between the current position and the goal, allowing a direct move to the goal.
Selected Point: [4, 4]
Evaluation: The path to the goal is clear from here, permitting a direct move to [4, 4].
Generated Path: [[25, 25], [21, 7], [10, 6], [4, 4]]
